/**
 * Big O of Hash Tables---------------------------------------
 * The hash method itself is O(1) constant time
 * The set method is O(1) constant time
 * The get method is O(1) constant time. Only by the key is O(1)
 */

// The hash fucntion is going to be very efficient at randomizing the addresses where things get assigned

/**
 * Both Insert and Lookup by key in a Hash Table is O(1)
 * Since a Hash Table is O(1) for Insert and Lookup it is always better than a Binary Search Tree
 * Looking up a value in a Hash Table is O(1)
