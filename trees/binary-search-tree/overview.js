// Binary Search Tree
// O(log n) -> best scenario
// conquer and divide apllied to binary search tree
// worst scenario is O(n) -> when the tree is not balanced
// lookup, insert and remove is O(log n)
// now, dcomparing with linked lists, where lookup is O(n), insert is O(1) and remove is O(n)
// insert is better for a linked list, but lookup and remove is better for a binary search tree
// lose efficiency inserting in the binary search tree, but gain efficiency in lookup and remove
//  insert count for duplications
